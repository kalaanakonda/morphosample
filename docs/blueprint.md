# **App Name**: ScrollPlay

## Core Features:

- Hero Video Loop: Automatically play and loop video 1 (https://github.com/kalaanakonda/Video-morpho/raw/refs/heads/main/aa11.webm) in the hero section by default.
- Scroll-Triggered Video Switch: Upon detecting the first scroll signal (even the smallest), immediately switch to and play video 2 (https://github.com/kalaanakonda/Video-morpho/raw/refs/heads/main/aa22.webm) until it ends.
- Video Controls: Provide basic video controls (play/pause, volume) for video 2. These controls will be discrete and not distract the visitor.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark, desaturated blue (#34495E) for a professional and reliable feel. 
- Background color: Very dark blue (#222F3D), slightly darker shade of primary, to make content stand out. 
- Accent color: Yellow-orange (#F39C12) to draw attention to key elements without clashing with videos.
- Font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif suitable for both headlines and body text
- Clean and minimalist layout focusing on the video content, ensuring ease of navigation.
- Smooth transition effect when switching between the looped video and the main content.
